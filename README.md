# Home server Introduction
Hello all!

My aim here is to document and share my homelab set up, including everything from the bottom up. Starting with the OS installation and various concepts such as setting basic configurations like SSH, setting up Docker and various applications that I am hosting. I will hopefully have walk throughs/guides to each container setup and include a Docker compose file. I am learning a lot and want to find a great way to keep track of everything I'm doing and hopefully learn a lot in trying to explain everything that I'm doing! For this repository, I will be focusing on my Raspberry Pi lab but hopefully in the future I will create some other repositories that cover some other projects, such as my Windows Active Directory Lab and some documentation on Linux commands. Feel free to reach out to provide feedback or to connect!
